## Diversification Benefits of Commodities

In Figure \@ref(fig:correlation), [Tang and Xiong (2012)](https://www.princeton.edu/~wxiong/papers/commodity.pdf) show the one-year rolling return correlations of oil with various commodities, together with the 95% confidence levels.

  - Assets which have a negative or low correlation with oil are desirable for diversification.
  - Notice the strong increase in the correlations in the run up to the commodity price boom of the mid 2000s.

# Case Studies:  Two Commodity ETFs

  - Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index (DJ-UBSCI) created in 2009 -- now called the Bloomberg Commodity Index. Read more from [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/commodities/dow-jones-ubs-commodity) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Commodity_Index)
  - [Powershares DB Agriculture Fund](https://etfdb.com/etf/DBA/#etf-ticker-profile) 
  - Benchmark with [Bank of Canada's commodity price index](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/price-indexes/bcpi/)

The number of futures contracts held for each commodity are adjusted on a regular basis because price changes will affect the weight a commodity has within a portfolio.

In Figure \@ref(fig:bloombergindex-ts), the Bloomberg Commodity Index (black) performed poorly from 2017 to early 2020. Recent growth is well below the S&P 500 (orange).

```{r bloombergindex-ts, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Bloomberg Commodity Index and S&P500", fig.align='center', out.width = "50%"}

```

[Jonathan Guyer (2012)](https://www.etf.com/publications/journalofindexes/joi-articles/12274-better-beta-in-commodities-indexing.html) blames poor performance of a crude oil ETF on frequent (once per month) contract rolling to avoid delivery. Rolling implies offseting a position in a futures contract set to expire, and taking a position in the next available contract. The author shows in Figure \@ref(fig:etf-rollyield) that rolling in a contango market results in a negative roll yield because for each roll, the investor is selling out of a lower-priced contract and buying into a higher priced contract. 

```{r etf-rollyield, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Bloomberg Commodity Index and S&P500", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/etf_rollyield.jpg")
```

In this lecture, we focus on roll yield for commodity futures. 

# Backwardation

In [Module 2D](https://vercammen.github.io/module2d.html) we used the eight quarter model to show that a USDA forecast for a sizeable weak Q8 carry out demand caused the forward curve to pivot down.

```{r backwardation, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Expected Spot Price Path and Forward Curve with Backwardation", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/backwardation.png")
```

# Contango 

Contango refers to an upward sloping forward curve. 

In [Module 2D](https://vercammen.github.io/module2d.html)  we used the eight quarter model to show that a USDA forecast for a sizeable strong Q8 cary out demand caused the forward curve to pivot up.

```{r contango, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Expected Spot Price Path and Forward Curve with Contango", fig.align='center', out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/contango.png")
```
